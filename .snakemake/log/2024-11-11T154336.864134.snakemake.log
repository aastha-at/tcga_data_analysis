MissingOutputException in rule plot in file /home/bec51310.iitr/workplace/project/tcga_data_analysis/test.smk, line 39:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
plot.png (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

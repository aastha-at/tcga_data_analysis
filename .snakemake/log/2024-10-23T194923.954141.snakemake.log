        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job read_data_pt since they might be corrupted:
tpm_pt.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

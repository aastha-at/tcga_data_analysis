NameError: The name 'print $1' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        grep "Primary Tumor" {input} | awk '{print $1}'> {output.pt}
        grep "Solid Tissue Normal" {input} | awk '{print $1} > {output.stn}

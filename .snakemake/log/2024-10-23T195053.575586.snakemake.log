Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule read_data_pt in file /home/bec51310.iitr/workplace/.project/tcga_data_analysis/snakemake.smk, line 15:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
tpm_pt.tsv (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
